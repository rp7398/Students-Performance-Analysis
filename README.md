# 📊 Student Performance Analysis & Dropout Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Python and identifying potential dropout risk through data-driven insights. The analysis highlights how demographic, academic, and socio-economic factors influence student outcomes.

The project is built as an **academic learning project** and demonstrates practical skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualization** using Python.  
The project was developed and executed using **Google Colab and VS Code**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze student performance across multiple subjects
- Identify factors affecting academic success
- Engineer meaningful features such as total and average scores
- Classify students into dropout risk categories
- Visualize insights for better interpretation and decision-making

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  
- VS Code  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Students Performance Dataset**
- Source: Kaggle

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Understanding  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Correlation Analysis  
6. Dropout Risk Classification (Rule-Based)  
7. Visualization and Insights  

---

## 📊 Features Engineered
- `total_score`
- `average_score`
- `dropout_risk` (High Risk / Medium Risk / Low Risk)

---

## 📈 Visualizations
All visualizations are stored inside the **visuals/** folder:
- Gender vs Average Score  
- Parental Education vs Performance  
- Lunch Type vs Performance  
- Test Preparation vs Performance  
- Score Correlation Heatmap  
- Dropout Risk Distribution  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Students who completed the test preparation course scored higher on average
- Students with standard lunch showed better academic performance
- Reading and writing scores are strongly correlated
- Parental education level positively impacts student performance
- Potential dropout risk can be identified early using academic indicators
